Executive Summary:
The scientizer system is a distributed platform designed to evaluate research papers based on their abstracts, identifying errors, contradictions, and inconsistencies. The system leverages AI scoring algorithms to assign scores to papers, highlighting potential issues. The implementation plan focuses on developing the core system components, including paper retrieval, data storage, abstract extraction, AI scoring, and paper ranking. The system will be built using a distributed architecture, with a focus on scalability and performance. The plan outlines the technical details, including database schemas, AI scoring prompts, and code structures, to ensure a robust and efficient implementation.

Build Plan:
Phase 1: Core System Development
1.1 Project Structure:
   - Set up a distributed project structure using Python packages:
     - `retrievers`: Package for paper retrieval modules.
     - `datastore`: Package for database and data storage modules.
     - `detectors`: Package for AI scoring modules.
     - `rankers`: Package for paper ranking modules.
     - `ui`: Package for user interface modules (planned but not yet implemented).

1.2 Retrievers Package:
   - Implemented the MendeleyRetriever class in `mendeley.py` which handles authentication with the Mendeley API, searches for papers based on a query, and stores the retrieved papers in the database. It also enqueues tasks for scoring papers using Celery.

1.3 Datastore Package:
   - Designed and implemented the database schema with `papers` and `error_scores` tables in `database.py`. The schema includes fields for paper metadata, error scores, explanations, and timestamps.

1.4 Detectors Package:
   - Created the `AIScorer` abstract base class and implemented the `OpenAIScorer` and `AnthropicScorer` classes in `ai_scorer.py`. These classes are responsible for scoring papers using AI models from OpenAI and Anthropic (placeholder implementation).

1.5 Rankers Package:
   - Implemented the `rank_papers_by_error_score` function in `paper_ranker.py` which ranks papers based on their error scores retrieved from the database.
     ```python
     import requests
     from mendeley import Mendeley
     
     def retrieve_papers(query):
         # Authenticate with Mendeley API
         mendeley = Mendeley(client_id, client_secret)
         session = mendeley.start_client_credentials_flow().authenticate()
         
         # Search for papers
         papers = session.catalog.search(query, view='bib')
         
         # Process and store the retrieved papers
         for paper in papers.iter():
             # Extract relevant metadata
             # Save the paper to the database
             # Push the paper ID to the task queue for further processing
     ```

1.3 Datastore Package:
   - Design the database schema:
     - `papers` table:
       ```sql
       CREATE TABLE papers (
           id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
           title TEXT,
           authors TEXT,
           abstract TEXT,
           altmetric_score INTEGER,
           created_at TIMESTAMP,
           updated_at TIMESTAMP
       );
       ```
     - `error_scores` table:
       ```sql
       CREATE TABLE error_scores (
           id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
           paper_id INTEGER REFERENCES papers(id),
           score INTEGER,
           explanation TEXT,
           created_at TIMESTAMP
       );
       ```
   - Implement the database module (`database.py`):
     ```python
     from sqlalchemy import create_engine, Column, Integer, String, Text, DateTime
     from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base
     from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker
     
     Base = declarative_base()
     
     class Paper(Base):
         __tablename__ = 'papers'
         id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
         title = Column(String(255))
         authors = Column(Text)
         abstract = Column(Text)
         altmetric_score = Column(Integer)
         created_at = Column(DateTime)
         updated_at = Column(DateTime)
     
     class ErrorScore(Base):
         __tablename__ = 'error_scores'
         id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
         paper_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey('papers.id'))
         score = Column(Integer)
         explanation = Column(Text)
         created_at = Column(DateTime)
     
     # Create database engine and session
     engine = create_engine('postgresql://username:password@host:port/database')
     Session = sessionmaker(bind=engine)
     ```

1.4 Detectors Package:
   - Create the `AIScorer` base class and implement `OpenAIScorer` and `AnthropicScorer` classes:
     ```python
     from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
     import openai
     import anthropic
     
     class AIScorer(ABC):
         @abstractmethod
         def score_paper(self, abstract):
             pass
     
     class OpenAIScorer(AIScorer):
         def __init__(self, api_key, prompt):
             self.api_key = api_key
             self.prompt = prompt
         
         def score_paper(self, abstract):
             # Use the OpenAI API to generate a score and explanation
             # Return the score and explanation
     
     class AnthropicScorer(AIScorer):
         def __init__(self, api_key, prompt):
             self.api_key = api_key
             self.prompt = prompt
         
         def score_paper(self, abstract):
             # Use the Anthropic API to generate a score and explanation
             # Return the score and explanation
     ```
   - Define the AI scoring prompt:
     ```
     You are an AI assistant trained to identify errors, contradictions, and inconsistencies in research paper abstracts. Your task is to analyze the provided abstract and assign a score from 1 to 100, where 1 indicates no issues and 100 indicates severe errors or contradictions that completely undermine the credibility of the research.

     Focus on the following aspects when scoring the abstract:
     - Logical inconsistencies or contradictions within the abstract
     - Factual errors or incorrect statements
     - Inconsistent or conflicting results or conclusions
     - Unclear or ambiguous language that hinders understanding
     - Obvious typographical or grammatical errors that impact clarity

     Provide a brief explanation for your score, highlighting the specific errors or contradictions you identified in the abstract. If you find no significant issues, assign a low score and explain why the abstract appears to be sound.
     ```

1.5 Rankers Package:
   - Implement the paper ranker module (`paper_ranker.py`):
     ```python
     def rank_papers(papers):
         # Calculate combined scores based on error scores and popularity metrics
         # Rank the papers based on the combined scores
         # Return the ranked list of papers
     ```

1.6 User Interface:
   - The design and implementation of the web application using a web framework like Flask or Django is planned but not yet implemented.
   - Create views and templates for displaying ranked papers, search functionality, and user authentication.

Phase 2: Integration and Testing
2.1 Integration:
   - Integrated the retriever, datastore, and detector modules into the main application. The ranker module is implemented but not yet integrated. The extractor module is not applicable as abstracts are directly retrieved from the Mendeley API.
   - Implemented a distributed task queue using Celery for asynchronous processing of scoring tasks.
   - The use of Redis for caching and storing intermediate results is planned but not yet implemented.

2.2 API Endpoints:
   - The implementation of RESTful API endpoints for paper retrieval, scoring, and ranking is planned but not yet implemented.
   - Define request and response formats using JSON.
   - Implement authentication and authorization for API access.

2.3 Testing:
   - Developed unit tests for the `tasks.py` and `ai_scorer.py` modules using pytest. Additional tests are needed for complete coverage.
   - Write integration tests to verify the interaction between components.
   - Perform load testing to ensure the system can handle a high volume of requests.
   - Conduct user acceptance testing with a group of researchers and gather feedback.

Phase 3: Deployment and Maintenance
3.1 Production Environment Setup:
   - The setup of the production environment, including server configuration and database setup, is planned but not yet implemented.
   - The use of containerization technologies like Docker for easy deployment and scalability is planned but not yet implemented.

3.2 Deployment:
   - The deployment of the scientizer system to the production environment is planned but not yet implemented.
   - The automation of the deployment process using tools like Ansible or Kubernetes is planned but not yet implemented.
   - The implementation of continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines is planned but not yet implemented.

3.3 Monitoring and Logging:
   - Implemented logging throughout the system to track operations and errors. Monitoring mechanisms are planned but not yet implemented.
   - The use of tools like Prometheus and Grafana for collecting and visualizing metrics is planned but not yet implemented.
   - The setup of log aggregation and analysis using ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) is planned but not yet implemented.

3.4 Maintenance:
   - Establishing a maintenance plan, including regular backups, software updates, and security patches, is planned but not yet implemented.
   - Monitoring and addressing security vulnerabilities and performance bottlenecks is planned but not yet implemented.

This build plan provides a focused and technical overview of the scientizer system implementation. It includes the project structure, key components, database schemas, AI scoring prompt, and code outlines for critical modules. The plan emphasizes the distributed nature of the system, utilizing technologies like task queues, caching, and containerization for scalability and performance.

The integration and testing phase ensures the smooth interaction between components and the reliability of the system. The deployment and maintenance phase highlights the importance of setting up a robust production environment, automating deployment processes, and implementing monitoring and logging mechanisms.

By following this build plan, the scientizer system can be developed as a technically sound and efficient platform for evaluating research papers based on their abstracts, identifying errors, contradictions, and inconsistencies.
