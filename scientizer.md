The system leverages AI scoring algorithms to assign scores to papers, highlighting potential issues. The implementation plan focuses on developing the core system components, including paper retrieval, data storage, abstract extraction, AI scoring, and paper ranking. The system will be built using a distributed architecture, with a focus on scalability and performance. The plan outlines the technical details, including database schemas, AI scoring prompts, and code structures, to ensure a robust and efficient implementation.

Build Plan:
Phase 1: Core System Development
1.1 Project Structure:
   - Set up a distributed project structure using Python packages:
     - `retrievers`: Package for paper retrieval modules.
     - `datastore`: Package for database and data storage modules.
     - `extractors`: Package for abstract extraction modules.
     - `detectors`: Package for AI scoring modules.
     - `rankers`: Package for paper ranking modules.
     - `ui`: Package for user interface modules.

1.2 Retrievers Package:
   - Implement the Mendeley retriever module (`mendeley.py`):
     ```python
     import requests
     from mendeley import Mendeley
     
     def retrieve_papers(query):
         # Authenticate with Mendeley API
         mendeley = Mendeley(client_id, client_secret)
         session = mendeley.start_client_credentials_flow().authenticate()
         
         # Search for papers
         papers = session.catalog.search(query, view='bib')
         
         # Process and store the retrieved papers
         for paper in papers.iter():
             # Extract relevant metadata
             # Save the paper to the database
             # Push the paper ID to the task queue for further processing
     ```

1.3 Datastore Package:
   - Design the database schema:
     - `papers` table:
       ```sql
       CREATE TABLE papers (
           id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
           title TEXT,
           authors TEXT,
           abstract TEXT,
           altmetric_score INTEGER,
           created_at TIMESTAMP,
           updated_at TIMESTAMP
       );
       ```
     - `error_scores` table:
       ```sql
       CREATE TABLE error_scores (
           id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
           paper_id INTEGER REFERENCES papers(id),
           score INTEGER,
           explanation TEXT,
           created_at TIMESTAMP
       );
       ```
   - Implement the database module (`database.py`):
     ```python
     from sqlalchemy import create_engine, Column, Integer, String, Text, DateTime
     from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base
     from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker
     
     Base = declarative_base()
     
     class Paper(Base):
         __tablename__ = 'papers'
         id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
         title = Column(String(255))
         authors = Column(Text)
         abstract = Column(Text)
         altmetric_score = Column(Integer)
         created_at = Column(DateTime)
         updated_at = Column(DateTime)
     
     class ErrorScore(Base):
         __tablename__ = 'error_scores'
         id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
         paper_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey('papers.id'))
         score = Column(Integer)
         explanation = Column(Text)
         created_at = Column(DateTime)
     
     # Create database engine and session
     engine = create_engine('postgresql://username:password@host:port/database')
     Session = sessionmaker(bind=engine)
     ```

1.4 Extractors Package:
   - Implement the abstract extractor module (`abstract_extractor.py`):
     ```python
     import PyPDF2
     
     def extract_abstract(file_path):
         with open(file_path, 'rb') as file:
             reader = PyPDF2.PdfFileReader(file)
             page = reader.getPage(0)
             text = page.extractText()
             # Extract the abstract from the text
             # Return the extracted abstract
     ```

1.5 Detectors Package:
   - Create the `AIScorer` base class and implement `OpenAIScorer` and `AnthropicScorer` classes:
     ```python
     from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
     import openai
     import anthropic
     
     class AIScorer(ABC):
         @abstractmethod
         def score_paper(self, abstract):
             pass
     
     class OpenAIScorer(AIScorer):
         def __init__(self, api_key, prompt):
             self.api_key = api_key
             self.prompt = prompt
         
         def score_paper(self, abstract):
             # Use the OpenAI API to generate a score and explanation
             # Return the score and explanation
     
     class AnthropicScorer(AIScorer):
         def __init__(self, api_key, prompt):
             self.api_key = api_key
             self.prompt = prompt
         
         def score_paper(self, abstract):
             # Use the Anthropic API to generate a score and explanation
             # Return the score and explanation
     ```
   - Define the AI scoring prompt:
     ```
     You are an AI assistant trained to identify errors, contradictions, and inconsistencies in research paper abstracts. Your task is to analyze the provided abstract and assign a score from 1 to 100, where 1 indicates no issues and 100 indicates severe errors or contradictions that completely undermine the credibility of the research.

     Focus on the following aspects when scoring the abstract:
     - Logical inconsistencies or contradictions within the abstract
     - Factual errors or incorrect statements
     - Inconsistent or conflicting results or conclusions
     - Unclear or ambiguous language that hinders understanding
     - Obvious typographical or grammatical errors that impact clarity

     Provide a brief explanation for your score, highlighting the specific errors or contradictions you identified in the abstract. If you find no significant issues, assign a low score and explain why the abstract appears to be sound.
     ```

1.6 Rankers Package:
   - Implement the paper ranker module (`paper_ranker.py`):
     ```python
     def rank_papers(papers):
         # Calculate combined scores based on error scores and popularity metrics
         # Rank the papers based on the combined scores
         # Return the ranked list of papers
     ```

1.7 User Interface:
   - Design and implement the web application using a web framework like Flask or Django.
   - Create views and templates for displaying ranked papers, search functionality, and user authentication.

Phase 2: Integration and Testing
2.1 Integration:
   - Integrate the retriever, datastore, extractor, detector, and ranker modules into the main application.
   - Implement a distributed task queue using Celery and RabbitMQ for asynchronous processing of papers.
   - Use Redis for caching and storing intermediate results.

2.2 API Endpoints:
   - Implement RESTful API endpoints for paper retrieval, scoring, and ranking.
   - Define request and response formats using JSON.
   - Implement authentication and authorization for API access.

2.3 Testing:
   - Develop unit tests for each module using testing frameworks like pytest or unittest.
   - Write integration tests to verify the interaction between components.
   - Perform load testing to ensure the system can handle a high volume of requests.
   - Conduct user acceptance testing with a group of researchers and gather feedback.
